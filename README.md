# IIST_Internship
This repository contains the .ipynb files for implementing a hybrid deep learning model aimed at performing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in cyber-physical systems. We integrate a physics based Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) - Bond Graph (BG) model with a hybrid CNN-LSTM Attention-Based deep learning framework to solve the problem of FDD by modelling it as a multi-class classification problem. Reference code is available at https://github.com/mohan696matlab/BG-CNN-for-DC-Motor-FDI.
